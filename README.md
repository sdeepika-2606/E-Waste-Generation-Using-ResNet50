# E-Waste-Generation-Using-ResNet50
Classify E-Waste using ResNet50 and TensorFlow
# ♻️ E-Waste Classification using ResNet50

This project uses deep learning (ResNet50) with TensorFlow to classify different types of e-waste from images.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is split into `train`, `validation`, and `test` folders with 10 e-waste categories.

## 🧠 Model
- Transfer learning with **ResNet50**
- Global average pooling, dropout, and dense output layer
- Trained with **early stopping** and evaluated on test data

## 📈 Results
Achieved ~XX% test accuracy (update this after training)

## 💾 Files
- `E_Waste_Classification.ipynb`: Full training + evaluation notebook
- `e_waste_resnet50.h5`: Trained model
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 🚀 Future Work
- Add Gradio-based drag-and-drop UI
- Try MobileNetV2 for faster inference

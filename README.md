# ♻️ E-Waste Classification using ResNet50

This project uses deep learning (ResNet50) with TensorFlow to classify different types of e-waste from images.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is split into `train`, `validation`, and `test` folders with 10 e-waste categories.

## 🧠 Model
- Transfer learning with **ResNet50**
- Global average pooling, dropout, and dense output layer
- Trained with **early stopping** and evaluated on test data
